# Interview Project

This is an example single page site for an interview.

# Getting Started

The project utilizes React.js and a WebPack build system. To view the pre-compiled page, check the `/dist` folder for the `index.html` page.

For development, it requires some simple setup at the command line:

- Run `npm install` to pull in dependencies
- Run `npm run watch` to compile assets and start local server

# Notes

- Technologies used:
    - React.js
    - SASS
    - WebPack
    - FontAwesome
    - Google Web Fonts
- Site is responsive with a pre-configured breakpoint at 768px.
- Card filtering for "Cats" and "Birds" was made functional within the React CheckboxContainer component.
- Additional CSS added for hover effects over cards.
- The description indicates 2 fonts are used: Open Sans and Passion One. After some research, I identified that this project also uses Montserrat in several places (also a Google Web Font).
